Running Java Files
---
A major change in this version is that we don’t need to compile the Java source files with javac explicitly anymore:

>$ javac HelloWorld.java\
$ java HelloWorld\
Hello Java 8!

Instead, we can directly run the file using the java command:

>$ java HelloWorld.java\
Hello Java 11!
